# Promises and Generators

In the previous lab you built a number of asynchronous functions. In several cases the result of one callback was used as the imput for a second asynchronous callback. This resulted in a deeply nested block of code, imagine if you needed to chain lots of these together!

In this lab we will be exploring a couple of powerful features of ECMAScript 6 to simplify the problem.

There is a slide deck https://goo.gl/D4Uszk to accompay this worksheet. Make sure you are familiar with its contents before proceeding.
