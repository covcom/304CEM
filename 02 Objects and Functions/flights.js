2. Function Expressions

More advanced stuff combining objects and functions.


needs to cover:
- Functions used as values
- Arrow syntax: should be the default option.
- Self-invoking functions? - immediately invoked function expressions (IIFE)
- getters and setters
- destructuring (fail soft)
- proxies (eg. for logging)
- reflect (opposite of proxy)
- symbols (new primitive type)
