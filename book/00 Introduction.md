# Introduction

This book covers advanced programming concepts using multiple paradigms. It is assumed that you are already comfortable writing and testing large amounts of code.

By the end of this book you will:

- Have learned cutting-edge JavaScript skills
- Be capable of developing powerful, complex APIs using NodeJS, a version of JavaScript that runs on the server
- Be able to employ industry-standard skills
- Be able to write complex automated testing suites
- Have mastered the key aspects of version control

So why learn about developing web APIs?

- Businesses rely on Web APIs.
- All modern websites and smartphone apps rely on APIs to communicate.
- JavaScript is the most popular language in the world.
- NodeJS is the most important language for server-side programming.

## Book Structure

The book is divided into three parts. In part (chapters 1-3) one we cover the principles behind the latest JavaScript (ECMA) language. In part two (chapters 4-6) we cover how to design RESTful APIs and how to build these. In the final part we cover a range of advanced topics to help you when you start writing more complex API.
